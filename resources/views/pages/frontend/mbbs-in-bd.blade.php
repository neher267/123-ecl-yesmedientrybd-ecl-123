                    <h3>RESERVE YOUR SEAT FOR MBBS IN BANGLADESH ADMISSION 2019-2020</h3>
                    <hr />

                    <p> Let us examine a few more options apart from <span class="bold">MBBS in Bangladesh</span>.</p>
                    <p> In 2018, many of the students were waiting for NEET exam. These students made a big mistake since the application deadline for most of the MCI approved <span class="bold">MBBS Abroad Universities</span> passed.</p>
                    <p> As a result, they might have wasted one more year by repeating it, <span class="bold">Medientry(BD)</span> offers you an innovative solution by reserving your seat and taking the admission letter in your hand as your PLAN B.</p>
                    <p> In case you get the admission through NEET 2019, you don&#39;t have to go to your chosen university for <span class="bold">MBBS abroad.</span>&nbsp;However, in case you do not make it, at least your backup plan is ready.</p>
                    <p> Hence, it would be a smart decision for those students who already booked their medical seats.</p>
                    <p> You must take note of these important points:</p>
                    <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 15px;">
                        <li> The fees of <span class="bold">private medical colleges in India</span> have been jacked up by almost 50% reaching around Rs. 75 lacs for the full course. Within a half of this budget, you can complete <span class="bold">MBBS in Bangladesh</span> + MD / MS in Germany! It is very simple to carve a global career for medical practitioners now.</li>
                        <li> The admission to the Government medical colleges would be only for top 2-3% of the NEET takers.</li>
                    </ul>
